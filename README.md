# Maternal Health Risk Prediction 🚼🩺

A comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting maternal health risk levels — **low**, **mid**, or **high** — using clinical data. This model helps in early detection of risks to improve maternal care outcomes.

## 📖 Project Overview

Maternal health complications are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to classify pregnant women into risk categories based on vital health parameters, supporting timely interventions and better healthcare decisions.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data manipulation & visualization: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `imblearn`  
  - Model persistence: `joblib`  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂 Dataset Description

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Maternal Health Risk Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/maternal-health-risk-data)  
- **Features:** Age, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Blood Sugar, Body Temperature, Heart Rate  
- **Target Variable:** Risk Level (`High risk`, `Mid risk`, `Low risk` mapped to 0, 2, 1 respectively)  
- **Size:** Approximate number of records and features (mention if known)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for null and duplicate values  
- Visualized data distributions with histograms and boxplots  
- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships  
- Class distribution shown through pie and bar charts  
- Outlier removal and data cleaning performed

---

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing

- Label encoding for categorical target  
- Handling imbalanced classes using **SMOTE**  
- Feature scaling using **MinMaxScaler**  
- Removal of highly correlated features to reduce redundancy
